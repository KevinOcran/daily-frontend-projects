            Transistors, Logic gates, Integrated Circuits, Motherboards-building blocks of computers.
            The computer, a mind, a brain man-made that is powered by electric charges, bits. 
            Man-a technological marvel that is inexplicable by science, run by the human mind-a computer powered byâ€¦ dreams.

            My name is Kevin Ampong Ato Kwame Ocran and I was born on the same day as God. 
            I am a Fante. We believe God was born on a saturday and so just like me He is called Kwame. 
            I first came to Earth on February 5th, 2005. The first place I ever visited was a town on the souhern coast of Ghana. 
            It was there I first met my mother and father as a couple, where I lost my parents and where I gained them as individuals but, this is my story not theirs.

        <p>
            Over my years on Earth, I have learnt to fear, to hate, to cry, to laugh and to love. 
            Of all the things I have learnt, the most important is computers. 
            I have learnt how to type on a computer , how to play with it and I now pursue how to communicate with it for you see, we share a common attribute-computers and I- we dream and we do It occasionally.
        </p>

        <P>
            Java, JavaScript, Python, C++ , even HTML and CSS. I want to know it all(any language my computer understands, I want to understand).
            So I have embarked on this 5 month Journey to understand my computer more and This is the first step.

        <p>
            My name is Kevin Ampong Ato Kwame Ocran and my computer and I are Occasional Dreamers.
