        </h2>

        <p>
            As Stated in the <em><a href="/daily-frontend-projects/20250817-hello-html/index.html" target="_top" style="color: black;">Biography</a></em>, The Goal of this set of projects is to teach myself the language of computers.
            My aim is to become well versed in programming, and to understand how computers work at a fundamental level.
            This project is a step towards that goal, allowing me to explore web development and the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            I intend to learn the relationships computers have with other computers and humans as well.
